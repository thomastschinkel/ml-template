# ML - Template

A simple, well-structured Machine Learning project template.

You can use this template as a starting point for any ML project, regardless of framework (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).

## Project structure

```
ml-template/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Datasets (raw and processed)
â”œâ”€â”€ experiments/ # To track experiments (results, notes, configs, and models)
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and prototyping
â”œâ”€â”€ src/ # Source code (data, models, utils)
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/ # Unit tests for code validation (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore # Files and folders ignored by git
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE # License for the repo (MIT)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Repo overview and instructions
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt # Python dependencies
```

## Information

This repository is a template for starting any Machine Learning project.  
It provides a well-structured folder layout and placeholder files to help you organize your project efficiently.  

Key points:
- Framework-agnostic: works with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other ML library.
- Ready-to-use structure for data, experiments, notebooks, source code, and tests.
- Designed for both research experiments and production-ready projects.
- Includes a README.md in each folder explaining it's purpose.

Use this template as a starting point to create reproducible, clean, and maintainable ML projects.

## Getting started

### 1. Locally
   1. Clone the repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/thomastschinkel/ml-template.git
      cd ml-template
      ```
   2. Create a virtual environment
      ```bash
      python -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
      .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
      ```
   3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
```
   You can modify requirements.txt as needed to avoid installing unnecessary dependencies. Currently it only contains the Top 10. ML libraries in Python
   
### 2. Cloud
   1. Clone the repository:
      ```bash
      !git clone https://github.com/thomastschinkel/ml-template.git
      %cd ml-template
      ```
   2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    !pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   Some installations will be skipped as these libraries are often pre-installed on cloud-environments.
   
   **Note:** You have to run these commands in a notebook cell. 
   
**Now you are ready to start your ML-Project.ðŸš€**
